# Dasy 0.2.0a1 Release - Vyper 0.4.2 Migration Complete! üöÄ

We're excited to announce **Dasy 0.2.0a1**, a major alpha release that brings full compatibility with **Vyper 0.4.2**! This update represents a significant milestone in Dasy's evolution, incorporating all the latest improvements and security enhancements from the Vyper ecosystem.

## üéØ What's New

### Vyper 0.4.2 Compatibility
Dasy now compiles to and leverages all the optimizations, security improvements, and new features available in Vyper 0.4.2, giving you access to the latest and greatest in EVM smart contract compilation.

### Enhanced External Call Syntax
We've completely overhauled external contract interaction syntax to align with Vyper 0.4.2's new security-focused approach:

#### Before (Dasy 0.1.x):
```clojure
;; External calls were limited and inconsistent
(contract-call target-contract method args)
```

#### After (Dasy 0.2.0a1):
```clojure
;; Explicit, type-safe external calls
(extcall (target-contract.method arg1 arg2))        ; For state-changing calls
(staticcall (target-contract.view-method))          ; For view/pure calls

;; Interface-based calls
(extcall ((. (MyInterface addr) transfer) to amount))
(staticcall ((. (MyInterface addr) balanceOf) owner))
```

## üîÑ Breaking Changes & Migration Guide

### 1. Integer Division Operator
**Change**: The `/` operator now performs floating-point division; use `//` for integer division.

```clojure
;; Before
(/ 10 3)  ; Performed integer division

;; After  
(// 10 3) ; Integer division (returns 3)
(/ 10 3)  ; Would be floating-point (not typically used in smart contracts)
```

### 2. Enum ‚Üí Flag Migration
**Change**: `defenum` has been replaced with `defflag` to align with Vyper's flag system.

```clojure
;; Before
(defenum Status
  :pending
  :active  
  :inactive)

;; After
(defflag Status
  :pending
  :active
  :inactive)
```

### 3. Loop Variable Type Annotations
**Change**: All loop variables must now have explicit type annotations.

```clojure
;; Before
(for [i (range 10)]
  (some-operation i))

;; After
(for [i :uint256 (range 10)]
  (some-operation i))
```

### 4. Struct Instantiation
**Change**: Struct constructors now use keyword-only syntax.

```clojure
;; Before
(Person {:name "Alice" :age 30})

;; After
(Person :name "Alice" :age 30)
```

### 5. Event Logging Syntax
**Change**: Event emissions now require keyword-only arguments.

```clojure
;; Before
(log (Transfer sender receiver amount))

;; After  
(log (Transfer :sender sender :receiver receiver :amount amount))
```

### 6. External Call System
**Change**: New explicit external call syntax for better security and clarity.

```clojure
;; Before
(contract.method args)

;; After
(extcall (contract.method args))        ; For state changes
(staticcall (contract.method args))     ; For view/pure calls
```

### 7. Nonreentrant Decorator
**Change**: The nonreentrant decorator no longer takes parameters.

```clojure
;; Before
(defn transfer [...] [:external (nonreentrant "lock")]
  ...)

;; After
(defn transfer [...] [:external :nonreentrant]
  ...)
```

### 8. Built-in Function Names
**Change**: Some built-in functions have been renamed.

```clojure
;; Before
(_abi_encode data)
(_abi_decode data type)

;; After
(abi_encode data)
(abi_decode data type)
```

## üÜï New Features

### Module System Support (Preview)
Dasy now includes basic parsing support for Vyper 0.4.2's new module system:

```clojure
;; Import modules
(uses my-library)

;; Initialize modules
(initializes my-library)

;; Export functions
(exports my-function)
```

*Note: Full module resolution and import functionality is coming in a future release.*

### Enhanced Interface Support
Improved interface definitions and usage:

```clojure
(definterface IERC20
  (defn totalSupply [] :uint256 :view)
  (defn balanceOf [:address account] :uint256 :view)
  (defn transfer [:address to :uint256 amount] :bool :nonpayable))

;; Usage with explicit calls
(defn check-balance [:address token :address user] :uint256 [:external :view]
  (staticcall ((. (IERC20 token) balanceOf) user)))
```

### Improved Type Safety
- Enhanced type checking and validation
- Better error messages for type mismatches  
- Stricter enforcement of mutability constraints

## üìä Performance & Reliability

### Test Suite Results
- **39/39 tests passing** (100% success rate)
- Full compatibility with Vyper 0.4.2 compilation pipeline
- Enhanced error reporting and debugging support

### Compiler Improvements
- Faster compilation times
- Better memory usage
- Improved error messages with precise source locations

## üõ†Ô∏è Migration Steps

1. **Update Dependencies**:
   ```bash
   # Update to Dasy 0.2.0a1
